    <h1> How affordable are HDB resale flats that have just MOP-ed* in Singapore? </h1>
    <h3>*MOP = Minimum Occupation Period. These flats are newly-minted first generation resale flats </h3>
    
    <h2> What </h2>

<p> Through the visualizations, we seek to illustrate the resale flat patterns of these MOP flats to comment on their affordability. The data used is obtained from Data.gov.sg (HDB, URA) and Singstat. </p>


<h2> Why </h2>

<p> 80% of the population resides in HDBs in Singapore. While HDB was birthed as a social policy to provide affordable housing to Singapore Citizens/Permanent Residents, opportunistic flat owners have been rapidly selling BTO-es once MOP has been reached for a windfall capital gain. These data visualizations seek to shed light on what the market has been up to recently, and can be used to inform potential buyers of new resale flats with the longest remaining lease.  </p>

<h2>How </h2>
